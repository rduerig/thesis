\section{Concepts}
Here are general game playing concepts and definitions:

\begin{description}
\item[Perfect Information] A game has the property of perfect information when both players know the full state of the game.
\item[Stochastic] A game is stochastic if it has elements of randomness, such as dice rolls. Backgammon is stochastic while Chess, Hex and Havannah are not.
\item[Zero Sum Games] A zero sum game has the property that one players gain is the other players loss. A draw is still possible, but no move can help both players, so there is no incentive to cooperate.
\item[State] A state is a full description of a board position. It includes the locations of all the pieces, and any other relevant information. In chess, the state would include whether each king can castle, and whether a pawn can capture \textit{en passant}. In games where repeated moves are not allowed, the full game history may be included in the state. Occasionally a simplified version of the state is used when speed is more important than accuracy.
\item[Move] A move is a distinct action by one of the players leading from one state to another state. In games with multi-part moves, such as Amazons where each move consists of a movement plus shooting an arrow, the pair of actions would be considered a single move. There are usually multiple moves available from each state, but usually only one can be chosen per turn.
\item[History] All moves leading from some starting position, usually the beginning of the game, to the current state.
\item[Branching Factor] is the number of moves available to each player on average. This depends on the rules of the game, board size, pieces in play and the stage of the game. This can be as low as 1 for forced moves, or very high, such as in the hundreds or thousands for Amazons or Arimaa.
\item[Game Tree] Games can be represented as a game tree. Each position in the game is a node, and each move is an edge in the graph connecting the position before the move to the position after the move. When there are multiple paths to a position, it can be represented as separate nodes, leading to a tree, or combined as a single node, leading to a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Some games have loops, where a position can be reached multiple times in a single game, leading to a directed graph.
\item[Root Node] The root node is the highest node in the tree. It has no parents, and there is exactly one of them in any tree.
\item[Leaf Node] A leaf node is any node that has no children.
\item[Node Value] Each node has an associated outcome or expected outcome associated with it. Terminal positions are positions where one of the players has won or it is a draw, have an exact value such as win, loss or draw, or a score to show how much a player won by.
\item[Heuristic] A heuristic function takes a position and returns a value associated with the position. This value often represents the likelihood of winning from that position, but can also be just an abstract number that can be compared against other values to order nodes or moves.
\item[State Space] is the number of unique reachable states in the game.
\item[Game Complexity] is the size of the state space, sometimes taking transpositions into account. This can either be the number of unique positions or the number of possible games.
\item[Minimax] In 2-player games, each player attempts to win at the expense of the other player. To do so, each player attempts to minimize the opponent's gain while maximizing their own gain. To win, a player must at at least one winning move, but to lose all moves must be losing moves.
\item[Minimax Backup] Given a node N who's children all have known values, N's value is equal to the value of the most favourable child for the current player.
\item[Minimax Value] The value of a node given that both players play perfectly according to Minimax.
\item[Transposition] One state with multiple histories. If moves A-X-B leads to the same position and state as B-X-A, they are transpositions. They are the same state, so they will have the same minimax value, and should not be searched twice.
\item[Hash Value] A hash value is a representative number of a state used to detect transpositions. Transpositions all have the same hash value, but different states have different hash values. Often collisions are possible so two states that aren't a transposition have the same hash value, but this is very rare as large hash values (usually 64 bit unsigned integers) are used.
\item[Zobrist Hash] In some search spaces a hash value can be built up incrementally by XORing a random string associated with each move against a previous hash value.
\item[Depth First Search] In a depth first search (DFS), nodes are considered in a depth-first way. The full subtree of a node will be explored before any of its siblings will be explored. This is very memory efficient since it only needs to store the nodes along the path from the root to the current node, but leaves many nodes near the root unexplored for long periods of time.
\item[Breadth First Search] In a breadth first search, all nodes at a specific depth will be considered before any nodes at a deeper depth, in increasing depth. This is very memory intensive as all nodes up to the specified depth must be kept in memory.
\item[Best First Search] In a best first search nodes are explored in order of their heuristic value. Promising nodes are explored before less promising nodes. This is very memory intensive as all nodes explored to date must be kept in memory.
\item[Anytime algorithm] An anytime algorithm can return an answer at any point of execution, but continues to run to provide a more accurate and potentially better answer.
\end{description}

Game playing programs all build a game tree, and then chose the most promising move at the root of the tree.

\section{Minimax}

The minimax algorithm is the foundation of all game playing algorithms and was invented before computers. The goal is the find the minimax value of a state or set of states, or equivalently for a set of moves. All values are from the perspective of the root player. The value of a node for the root player is the maximum of its children nodes, and the minimum for the opponents children. The pseudocode for a simple depth first search version is shown in Figure \ref{fig:minimaxcode}.

\begin{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}
int minimax(State state){
	if(state.terminal())
		return state.value();
	int value;
	if(state.player() == 1){
		value = -INF;
		foreach(state.successors as succ)
			value = max(value, minimax(succ));
	}else{
		value = INF;
		foreach(state.successors as succ)
			value = min(value, minimax(succ));
	}
	return value;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\caption{Minimax Pseudocode}
\label{fig:minimaxcode}

\end{figure}


\subsection{Negamax}

Minimax uses values as taken from a fixed perspective of the root player. This complicates the code with having to minimize for one player and maximize for the other. Noting that $max(a,b) = −min(−a,-b)$, the duplication can be removed by negating the value each time we switch perspective. In this setup all values returned from an evaluation function must be from the perspective of the player who is making the move. The pseudocode for this transformation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:negamaxcode}.

\begin{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}
int negamax(State state){
	if(state.terminal())
		return state.value();
	int value = -INF;
	foreach(state.successors as succ)
		value = max(value, -negamax(succ));
	return value;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\caption{Negamax Pseudocode}
\label{fig:negamaxcode}
\end{figure}

Several algorithms shown later reference the negamax formulation, and mean that the perspective shifts after every move.


\section{Alpha-Beta}\label{sec:alphabeta}

Alpha-beta ($\alpha\beta$) is a refinement of minimax, ignoring or pruning parts of the game tree that are provably unreachable if both players play perfectly. It maintains two bounds to store the minimum value each player is guaranteed given the tree searched so far. When these bounds meet or cross, this is called a cut-off, and the remaining moves don't need to be considered. 

The pseudocode for alpha-beta, written in the negamax formulation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:abcode}. It is a depth first implementation that returns after a maximum depth is reached. If a terminal node is found, the true value is returned, otherwise a heuristic value is returned.

\begin{figure}

\begin{lstlisting}
int alphabeta(State state, int depth, int alpha, int beta){
	if(state.terminal() || depth == 0)
		return state.value();
	foreach(state.successors as succ){
		alpha = max(alpha, -alphabeta(succ, depth-1, -beta, -alpha));
		if(alpha >= beta)
			break;
	}
	return alpha;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\caption{Alpha-beta Pseudocode, shown in the negamax formulation}
\label{fig:abcode}
\end{figure}

The runtime of alpha-beta is highly dependent on the branching factor $b$, search depth $d$, and the number of cut-offs. Minimax has a runtime of $b^d$, as does alpha-beta if it has no cut-offs. Given perfect move ordering, only the first move for the root player will need to be considered, leading to a runtime of $b^{d/2}$, or an exponential speedup. In general, we don't have perfect move ordering, so the runtime will be between these two extremes.

\subsection{Transposition Table}

Transpositions can lead to an exponential blowup in the search space. To minimize the number of transpositions reevaluated, all strong alpha-beta based programs use a transposition table. Transpositions are found by comparing hash values and indexing into a large table. Sometimes a hash table is used, but usually the number of nodes searched is too big to store in memory, so a simple replacement policy is used. The simplest is to use the hash value as an index into a large array of values, replacing the previous node that indexed to the same location.

In many games this leads to a large speedup as the number of nodes searched is decreased dramatically.


\subsection{Iterative Deepening}

The runtime of alpha-beta is exponential in the search depth, and the strength of a player is dependent on a large search depth. If the algorithm is stopped before completion, the best move may not have been explored at all, so a shallower search that finishes is likely better than a deeper search that doesn't. Thus we start with a shallow search, and run a deeper search if we have time. This is not a big waste of work since the majority of the runtime is spent at the deepest level anyway. Iterative deepening allows alpha-beta to act as a breadth-first search with the memory overhead of a depth-first search.

Iterative deepening, when combined with a transposition table, also gives better move ordering. A nodes value from the previous iteration is going to be a more accurate estimate of the value of a node than a heuristic estimate without a search. As we saw in section \ref{sec:alphabeta}, better move ordering can lead to an exponential speedup, easily offsetting the overhead from searching the shallow depths multiple times.

\subsection{Other extensions}

Negascout, history heuristic, killer move, quiescence search, etc. Are these worth including at all?


\section{Proof Number Search} \label{sec:PNS}

Proof Number Search (PNS) is a best-first search used to answer binary questions such as the outcome of a 2-player game starting from a given state. Being a binary outcome with the minimax property, it is well represented as an AND/OR tree when all values are from the perspective of the root player. Each node in the tree can have one of three values: Proven/Win, Disproven/Loss, or Unknown. All nodes store 2 numbers that show how close it is to be proven or disproven. The proof number (pn) is the minimum number of leaf nodes in the subtree that must be proven for the node to be proven. The disproof number (dn) is the minimum number of leaf nodes in the subtree that must be disproven for the node to be disproven. Some leaf nodes, if solved, will change the proof number of the root. Other leaf nodes, if solved, will change the disproof number of the root. Others, if solved, won't affect the proof or disproof numbers of the root. The Most Proving Nodes (MPN) are the intersection of the set that affect the proof number and the set that affect the disproof number at the root. Solving a Most Proving Node will definitely affect either the proof or disproof number of the root. Every tree is guaranteed to have at least one most proving node. Proof Number search grows its tree by continually expanding a most proving node. Proof Number search can be split into 3 phases: descent, expansion, and update.

The most proving node is found during the descent phase. It can be found by selecting the child with the minimum proof number when at an OR node and by selecting the child with the minimum disproof number when at an AND node, applying this iteratively until a leaf node is reached. This leaf node is an MPN.

%Once the most proving node $n$ is found, it is expanded, initializing all non-terminal children with $n.pn = 1, n.dn = 1$, winning children with $n.pn = 0, n.dn = \infty$ and losing children with $n.pn = \infty, n.dn = 0 $.

Once the most proving node $n$ is found, it is expanded, initializing all non-terminal children with $n_i.pn = 1, n_i.dn = 1$, winning children with $n_i.pn = 0, n_i.dn = \infty$ and losing children with $n_i.pn = \infty, n_i.dn = 0 $, where $n_i$ refers to the $i^{th}$ child of $n$.

After expansion, the proof and disproof numbers of all the ancestors of the most proving node must be updated using these formulas. For OR nodes: $$ n.pn = \displaystyle\min\limits_{i=0}^k n_i.pn,\quad n.dn = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=0}^k n_i.dn $$ For AND nodes: $$ n.pn = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=0}^k n_i.pn, \quad n.dn = \displaystyle\min\limits_{i=0}^k n_i.dn $$ Note how this backs up a single win at an OR node as a win, or a single loss at an AND node as a loss. It also backs up all losses at an OR node as a loss, or all wins at an AND node as a win. % Everywhere else it represents the optimistic lower bound on the number of nodes that must be (dis)proven to (dis)prove the current node.

These three phases are repeated until the root is solved or the tree grows too big to be stored in memory. At the root, if $r.pn = 0$ it is solved as a win, or if $r.dn = 0$ it is solved as a loss, otherwise it is still unknown.

\label{fig:pntree}
\end{figure}

Consider the tree in Figure \ref{fig:pntree}. The most proving node is found by following the edges $a \rightarrow b \rightarrow e \rightarrow j$. If $j$ has a child that is a win, it would be backed up as a win at $j$, leading to a win at $e$, and a win at $b$, giving the root player a winning move from the root. With $a.pn = 1$ at the root, only 1 node was needed to be proven as a win for the root to also be proven as a win. If both $j$ and $l$ were proven to be losses, then $e$ would be a loss, leading $b$ to also be a loss, and consequently the root to also be a loss. This is reflected in $a.dn = 2$ at the root. If, however, $j$ has 1 non-terminal child $m$ and no terminal children, $m$ would have $m.pn = 1, m.dn = 1$ and would be the new MPN. If $j$ has 2 non-terminal children and no terminal children, $j.pn = 2, j.dn = 1$, and $l$ would be the new MPN. 

This algorithm selects nodes based on the shape and value of the tree, using no domain or game specific heuristic. It is guided towards slim parts of the tree, areas where there are few moves available, or where many moves are forced. In many games it is advantageous to have more moves available, or higher mobility, than your opponent. Proof Number search is very fast at solving these positions. In games or positions where the branching factor is constant or consistent, with few forced moves, Proof Number search approximates a slow breadth-first search, and thus isn't very fast.

Being a best-first search algorithm, the whole tree must be kept in memory, since any node could become the MPN and therefore be searched at any time. This makes it a very memory intensive search algorithm, with many of the variants attempting to reduce memory usage, allowing bigger problems to be solved.

One simple optimization is to stop the update phase once the proof and disproof numbers don't change. This often happens when siblings have the same value, causing the sibling to be the new MPN. A new search can be started from this node instead of from the root. A simple memory optimization is to remove and reuse the memory of subtrees under a proven or disproven node.

\caption{Proof Number search tree using the Negamax formulation, all nodes are OR nodes, $\phi$ is on top, $\delta$ is below, based on \cite{winands2003-PDS-PN}}
\label{fig:negamaxtree}
\end{figure}

Just like minimax can be written in the negamax formulation, so too can proof number search. The Proof number at an OR node is the same as the Disproof number at an AND node, and is named $\phi$ (phi). Similarly, the Proof number at an AND node is the same as the Disproof number at an OR node, and is named $\delta$ (delta). Instead of considering all nodes to be from the one player's perspective, all nodes are considered to be from the player who is making the move at that node. This shift in perspective greatly simplifies the code for all variants of proof number search.

Figure \ref{fig:negamaxtree} shows the same tree as in Figure \ref{fig:pntree}, except using the negamax formulation. Note how all nodes are now OR nodes, and the proof and disproof numbers are exchanged in the nodes that were previously AND nodes.

Given this shift in perspective, the descent and update formulas need to be corrected. The new descent move selection is always to choose the child with the minimum delta. The new update formulas are: $$ n.\phi = \displaystyle\min\limits_{i=0}^k n_i.\delta, \quad n.\delta = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=0}^k n_i.\phi $$

\subsection{Transposition Table}

Proof number search uses an explicit tree which must be kept in memory, but the tree required is often bigger than available memory. One common approach to bounding the memory needed is to store the nodes in a transposition table instead of an explicit tree. This has the benefit of bounded memory as well as saving computation and memory on transpositions, at the cost of having to recompute nodes that are replaced in the transposition table. Even when a node needs to be recomputed, its children are often still in the transposition table, allowing for a quick recomputation. In many cases the transposition table can be several orders of magnitude smaller than would be needed to store the explicit tree.


\subsection{DF-PN: Depth First Proof Number search} \label{sec:DF-PN}

Depth First Proof Number search (DF-PN)\cite{nagai1999-DFPN} uses two thresholds which are set to express how long the MPN stays in the current subtree. The thresholds are calculated based on the realization that there is no need to update the parents $\phi$ and $\delta$ and do a new move selection if the next descent will go to the same child node. As long as the child's $\delta$ is smaller or equal to all of its siblings, an MPN still lies in its subtree. By staying within this subtree, fewer updates are needed, and locality is maintained, using fewer active nodes and needing less recomputation.

$n.th_\phi$ and $n.th_\delta$ are both set to $\infty$ at the root. $n.th_\phi$ and $n.th_\delta$ are computed as follows: $$n_c.th_\phi = n.th_\delta + n_c.\phi - \displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=0}^k n_i. \phi$$ $$n_c.th_\delta = min(n.th_\phi, n_2.\delta + 1)$$ where $n_c$ refers to the child with the smallest $\delta$ and $n_2$ is the child with the second smallest $\delta$. The search process continues at each node until $n.\phi \geq n.th_\phi$ or $n.\delta \geq n.th_\delta$.


\subsection{DF-PN+: DF-PN with Heuristics} \label{sec:DF-PN+}

So far proof number search assumes that all leaf nodes are equally hard to prove, using only proof and disproof numbers, or more generally, the shape of the tree. DF-PN+ adds two types of heuristic evaluation \cite{nagai-thesis}. 

$h(n)$ is a heuristic evaluation of the expected difficulty of proving or disproving a node and its subtree. DF-PN has a constant $h(n) = 1$. A small value means that this node is expected to be easy to (dis)prove while a big value means this node is expected to be hard to (dis)prove. This value is used at node initialization of non-terminal nodes: $$n.\phi = h_\phi(n), \quad n.\delta = h_\delta(n)$$

$cost(n, n_c)$ is a cost for moving from a node to a child, and affects the shape of the tree. DF-PN has a constant $cost(n, n_c) = 0$. Small values encourage narrow and deep trees while large values encourage wide and shallow trees. This value is a penalty to going deeper, and could be used to encourage deeper trees on moves that are evaluated to be better, or to find shallower solutions.

Adding a non-zero $cost$ function means changing the update formulas: $$ n.\phi = \displaystyle\min\limits_{i=0}^k (n_i.\delta + cost_\delta(n, n_c))$$ $$n.\delta = \displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=0}^k (n_i.\phi + cost_\phi(n, n_c))$$ as well as the threshold formulas:
$$n_c.th_\phi = n.th_\delta + n_c.\phi - \displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=0}^k (n_i.\phi - cost_\delta(n, n_i))$$ $$n_c.th_\delta = min(n.th_\phi, n_2.\delta + cost_\phi(n, n_2) + 1) - cost_\phi(n, n_c)$$

While the values initialized by $h$ are overwritten when its children are expanded, the $cost$ persists until the node is solved. Given fast and effective $h$ and $cost$ functions, DF-PN+ can solve problems significantly faster than DF-PN.

\subsection{The $1+\epsilon{}$ Trick} \label{sec:epstrick}

One weakness of Proof Number search in general is it requires a large amount of memory to store the tree. Depth first variants and transposition tables help, but many problems we want to solve need trees that are several orders of magnitude bigger than available memory. In cases where the memory limit is particularly tight, DF-PN can spend a huge amount of time regenerating subtrees. To reduce this effect, the $1+\epsilon$ Trick \cite{pawlewicz2007epsilon} increases the thresholds exponentially instead of linearly.

Consider the case where two children of the root (so $\infty$ thresholds) are both promising, but also hard to solve. Since Proof Number search likes keeping all children at similar values, the two will get roughly equal time. Once the subtrees become big, the time spent on one will overwrite the nodes from the other tree. Once its $\delta$ exceeds the other, the search will switch, taking up a large amount of memory, and overwriting the nodes from the subtree of the first child. Since the threshold is one higher than the second smallest, they will swap every time the tree gets rebuilt to exceed the other child by one. This linear increase in the threshold can mean an exponential increase in time.

If the threshold was not simply the second smallest + 1, but instead a multiple of it, the investment into this subtree wouldn't be overwritten so easily by its equally challenging siblings. The $1 + \epsilon$ trick therefore is to replace the $n_c.th_\delta$ threshold from DF-PN with $$n_c.th_\delta = min(n.th_\phi, n_2.\delta*(1 + \epsilon))$$ where $\epsilon$ is some small positive value. This way $n_c.th_\delta$ increases by a constant multiple instead of a constant. It leads to $n_c$ being called at most $log_{1+\epsilon}n.th = O(log n.th)$ times instead of linear times before reaching its parent's threshold.

This trick encourages DF-PN to be even more depth-first, causing lower memory usage, more efficient usage of the transposition table, and reducing the number of node recalculations. Note that it no longer follows the same order as the original PNS, sometimes expanding a node that isn't an MPN, and therefore it may do an unbounded amount of extra work.

$\epsilon = 0.25$ has been shown to work well in practice.


\section{Monte Carlo Tree Search}

Based on statistics, doesn't need a heuristic evaluation function.

Monte Carlo Tree Search is an algorithm for building and exploring a game tree. It consists of four phases which together are called a simulation. Each simulation adds some experience to the tree, updating the expected chance of winning for the nodes it traverses. These winning rates are stored as the number of wins and the number of simulations through a node. The four phases are:
\begin{description}
\item[Descent] This phase descends the game tree from the root to a leaf node N in the game tree. At each node one of the available moves is selected according to some criteria based on the current winning rate and possibly heuristic knowledge. When the Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) formula is used, this is called Upper Confidence Bounds applied to Trees (UCT), but other formulas such as RAVE have been developed and are commonly used.
\item[Expansion] If the node N has experience from a previous simulation, its children are expanded, increasing the size of the tree.
\item[Rollout] A random game is played from N through the newly expanded children, to the end of the game. Heuristics can be used to make the moves less random and more representative of a real game. The strength of the overall algorithm is highly dependent on the average outcome of the random games being representative of the strength of the position.
\item[Back-propagation] The outcome of the random game in the rollout is back propagated to the moves chosen in the tree. The winning rate of the moves made by the player that won the rollout is increased while winning rate of the moves by the player that lost the rollout is decreased.
\end{description}

These four steps are repeated continually until a stopping condition is reached, such as running out of time or memory. At this point a move is chosen by some criteria. The three most common criteria are: most simulations, most wins, and highest lower confidence bound on winning rate.

Many extensions have been developed to increase the playing strength of MCTS. Some of these are explained below.
